# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for educational exercises, focusing on basic data structures and algorithms. The codebase is organized by topic, with each file representing a distinct exercise or concept.

## Key Files
- `diccionarios.py`: Exercises and examples using Python dictionaries.
- `tuplas.py`: Exercises and examples using Python tuples.
- `Ejercicio_1.py`: Likely contains a standalone exercise or assignment.
- `explicacion-combustible.py`: Likely an explanatory script related to fuel calculations or concepts.
- `README.md`: Placeholder for student and assignment information.

## Developer Workflow
- No build system or test framework is present; scripts are run directly with Python.
- Use Python 3.x for all scripts. No external dependencies are required unless specified in future exercises.
- Each script is self-contained. There is no cross-file import or shared module pattern.
- Debug by running scripts individually and inspecting output.

## Project-Specific Conventions
- Code is written for clarity and educational value, not production robustness.
- Variable names and comments should be descriptive and in Spanish, matching the educational context.
- Each file should start with a brief comment describing its purpose.
- Avoid advanced Python features unless required by the exercise.

## Example Patterns
```python
# Ejemplo de inicio de archivo
# Este archivo contiene ejercicios sobre diccionarios en Python

diccionario = {"clave": "valor"}
# ...m√°s ejemplos...
```

## Integration Points
- No external APIs or services are integrated.
- No persistent storage or database usage.

## How to Extend
- Add new exercises as separate `.py` files in the root directory.
- Update `README.md` with descriptions for new files if needed.

## Additional Notes
- This repository is intended for classroom use. Follow assignment instructions closely.
- If you add new conventions or patterns, document them here for future AI agents.
